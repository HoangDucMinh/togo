1. How to run?
  - NodeJS API:
    - npm install
    - npm start
    
  - Unit test 
    - npm test
  
  - Cypress automation test:
    - cd automation-test
    - npm install
    - npm run dev


2. CURL: 
  - getTodo: curl -X GET http://localhost:5050 tasks -H "Authorization: testabc.xyz.ahk"
  

3. My solution is based on simple structure,


4. If I had more time, I would handle the error when calling the api and show on screen in the most detail. I will use docker to create a database and query with real data and use jwt for login.
